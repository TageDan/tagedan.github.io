Alice and Bob are candle makers, but they have ran out of material. They decide to go dumpster diving for burnt out candles. They realize that if they melt three old candles they can make a new one. Alice manages to find 10 old candles and Bob also finds a handful. How many candles can Alice make for her own use?
