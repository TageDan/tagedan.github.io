You come into a room and see that someone has drawn a perfect circle on a paper. Beside it you see a *long* ruler, on which all the markings has unfortunatly decayed, and a *big* [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drawing_tool)). You are curiuos as to how they drew such a perfect circle. Can you use the compass and ruler to find where exactly the center of the circle lies?
