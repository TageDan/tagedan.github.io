You come into a room and see that someone has drawn a perfect circle on a paper. Beside it you see a *long* ruler, on which all the markings has unfortunately decayed, and a *big* <info-card><span slot=word>compass</span><span slot=info>A drawing tool for making circles<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/IMB_DQj3Fs.gif/220px-IMB_DQj3Fs.gif" /></span></info-card>. You are curious as to how they drew such a perfect circle. Can you use the compass and ruler to find where exactly the center of the circle lies?

Yes you can! The steps used to find the exact midpoint are shown in the figma slides below.

A relevant theorem is the <info-card><span slot=word>perpendicular bisector of chord theorem</span><span slot=info>the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle.</span></info-card>
